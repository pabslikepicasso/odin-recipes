# odin-recipes

The Odin Project's Recipes assignment requires participants to
demonstrate their knowledge on basic HTML elements and syntax.

In this project, students are to create a main webpage that
provides a list of links to auxiliary sites that lead to
different recipes. 

The main webpage (index.html) will contain links to these
recipe sites the student is also responsible of creating.

Elements like anchors, lists, images and headings should be
on full display. 

The first iteration, started on 11/17 13:58, will be barebone
HTML.
